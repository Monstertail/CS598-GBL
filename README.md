### Course Description

In this course, we will discuss recent advances in generative AI for biomedicine, with a special focus on geometric-aware deep learning, multimodal diffusion/flow matching on diverse data manifolds, and language models. We will also discuss foundational models for biomedicine and life sciences applications such as protein design, drug discovery, and understanding the functions and dynamics of complex biomolecular systems.

**Learning Objectives:** This course will introduce generative model basics, their application in biomedicines, and other impactful research works. At the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Have a good overview and basic knowledge of state-of-the-art generative models in biomedicines & life science
- Familiar with the research process: proposal, presentation, paper writing, review & rebuttal, hands-on experiments
- Have critical thinking and assessment of research papers

**Structure**: This will be a graduate-level course in seminar format.

- 6 instructor lectures: we will first review the biology & generative model basics. See schedule
- 1 project brain-storm session
- 15 paper-reading lectures: we will select 15 research sub-topics and reading lists for students to read, present, and discuss, covering the following topics:
    - Language models for biomedicine
    - Generative models for chemical molecules
    - Generative models for protein folding and design
    - Complex-based design with generative models: Structure-based drug design, peptide, antibody, enzyme, and molecular docking
    - RLHF/conditional generation/Guidance
- mid-term and final presentations

### Grading Policy

**Groups**: All activities of this course, except your attendance, will be performed in groups of 3 students, in a total of 15 groups. **By Feb 3**, most groups should submit their memberships (**exactly 3**) and topic preference (see 5 general topics in **Structure**). For students who do not find a group, we will assign groups according to their topic preference.

| **Component** | **Weight** | **Breakdown** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pre-class Reading | 10% | 10 pt 15 lectures |
| In-class Discussion | 30% | - 10% Presentation - 10% Rebuttal - 10% Review |
| Hands-on Experiments | 20% | - 10% Scripts & Generation Results - 10% Report |
| Final Project | 40% | - 5% Proposal - 15% Final Presentation - 20% Final Report |

**Pre-class Reading**

- Group Assignment: Each paper-reading lecture will have several required readings and optional related readings.  Each group should read at least one of the papers and submit at least 1 insightful question or idea related to the paper you read here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q-wPi2Ezbv0QJe8hN2tBNC15WmkPaquhuJqkT4p5bWk/edit?usp=sharing before the lecture.

**In-class Discussion**

- In each paper-reading lecture, 2 groups will be signed up as the main leaders of the discussion, with each group playing one of the 2 roles: **presenters** or **reviewers**. These 2 groups are required to submit assignments (see below). Other groups are encouraged to participate in class discussions. Throughout the semester, each group needs to sign up for each one of the roles once, totaling participation in 2 different subtopics.
- Group Assignment for designated presenters and reviewers:
    - For presenter: submit slides (at least 20 pages) for all required readings **before the lecture,** and present the papers **during the class (45 min presentation);** submit a rebuttal **within 6 days after the lecture**
    - For reviewers: submit academic reviews about required readings by **EOD of the lecture**

**Hands-on Experiments**

We’ll release 1-3 benchmark challenges during the semester. Each group should choose 1 challenge and use its codebase to generate results and evaluation metrics, and finish a short report like the experiment section in a paper. The report should cover experiment settings and results analysis. Each group should submit the experiment reports 2 weeks **before the final presentation (Apr 23).**

**Final Project**

Each group should complete a final project in one of the following types:

1. Comprehensive literature survey on one advanced subtopic in generative AI for biomedicine (doesn't need to be one of the subtopics of the lecture, but should be related to the topics of the class).
2. Benchmarking & dataset paper (opportunity to submit to Neurips Benchmark track)
3. Open-ended research (opportunity to submit to Neurips main track)

Each group should submit a proposal **by Mar 5 (1 week before mid-term)**, and a final report **by May 14 (1 week after the final presentation)**

**Late Day Policy**

Students may request one 3-day extension in the semester for full credit. Otherwise, late submission within 3 days results in at most 80% of credits. Submission later than 3 days results in 0% of credits.

### Tentative Schedule

Note: This is an evolving list. For each topic, the presenter should cover 2-3 required papers in their presentation.
